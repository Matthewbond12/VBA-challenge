VBA Challenge

Contributor: Matthew Bond

Overview 

For this project, I had to incorporate all the varied learnings and training materials provided to draft VBA code that would create a summary table for stock market data for the years 2018, 2019 and 2020. I used various if and for loop functions to create the summary table, apply conditional formatting and run the macro on all worksheets within the workbook. 

Part 1: Declaring variables

I identified the various inputs I would need to complete this task and begin assigning them as variables.

Part 2: Identifying Loops and If Statements

I worked with my TA to understand how best to loop through each line of code to return the specified value and setting the appropriate If/Then statements.

Part 3: Printing the Output:

After determing the appropriate for loops and if/then statements, I formulated how to print those values to the respective summary table with column headers.

Part 4: Running Macro on All Sheets:

I could not figure out how to best run the VBA script through all worksheets, so spent some time googling. The most common response was to use a For Each Loop and call the sub-routine housing my base code. The code for the runallloops() sub routine was adapted from wallstreetmojo.com. The remainder of the code is from my own inspiration and some help from my TA.
